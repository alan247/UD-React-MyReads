# MyReads Project

A simple app developed to get familiar with basic React concepts as part of Udacity's ReactND.

In the app you can organize books in three different shelves depending on their status (currently reading, want to read and read). There's also a search functionality that fetches books from an API hosted in Udacity's servers.

## Instructions

1. Download or fork this repository
2. Install all project dependencies with `npm install`
3. Run with `npm start`

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
